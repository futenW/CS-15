Handin: Final Hand-in

Overview: This is my teddy bear, Nana. My best friend and life-long companion,
          she was so excited to meet Blueno until she moved on campus and found
          he had graduated already o: Much was left to be desired until this cartoon
          eased some of her misery.

Design Choices: Instantiates four hearts, each made of one rectangle and four circles. Each heart moves up and down
                vertically, only visible when going up. Quit button and label are not visible until user has had a seizure
                (for aesthetic purposes).

Known Bugs: Whenever you hold down the arrow keys to change the colors, the RGB gets stuck at a certain color every few
            iterations, though I'm not sure why. Also, in general, you have to press the keys really hard to register
            for some reason :(
