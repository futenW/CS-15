Pacman README

Handin: May resubmit later

Overview:
    My Pacman has 13 classes: App, BoardCoordinate, Collidable (interface), Const(ants), Direction (enum),
    Dot, Energizer, Game, Ghost, GhostPen, Pacman, PaneOrganizer, and SmartSquare.
    Use arrow keys to move Pacman.

Design Choices:
    Alternates between 7 seconds of chase mode and 7 seconds of scatter mode. Fright mode lasts 7 seconds.

Known Bugs:
    Ghosts still turn 180 degrees during fright mode, even though they still use the BFS targeting mechanism (randomly) :(

Hours: approx. 24 hours

Extra credit: Pacman moves faster than the ghosts
